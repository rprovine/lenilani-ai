# HubSpot Lead Capture System - Complete Guide

This chatbot features automatic lead capture to HubSpot with full conversation tracking and source attribution.

## ‚úÖ What's Already Implemented

### Automatic Lead Detection
- **Email Detection**: Automatically detects when users share email addresses
- **Phone Detection**: Captures phone numbers when provided
- **Conversation Tracking**: Stores full conversation history
- **Auto-Capture**: Creates/updates HubSpot contacts automatically when email is detected

### HubSpot Integration Features
1. **Source Tracking**: All leads tagged as "LeniLani AI Chatbot"
2. **Conversation Notes**: Full conversation appended as notes to contact
3. **Lifecycle Management**: New contacts set as "Lead" status
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Updates existing contacts instead of creating duplicates
5. **Progressive Enrichment**: Adds phone, company, and other details as conversation progresses

## üîß Setup Required: Add Your HubSpot API Key

### Step 1: Find Your HubSpot API Key

You mentioned you have a HubSpot API key from a previous project. You can also create a new one:

1. Go to **HubSpot** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Integrations** ‚Üí **Private Apps**
2. Find your existing app OR click **Create a private app**
3. Required Scopes for Lead Capture:
   - `crm.objects.contacts.write`
   - `crm.objects.contacts.read`
   - `crm.schemas.contacts.read`
   - `crm.objects.notes.write`
4. Copy your API key (format: `pat-na1-...`)

### Step 2: Add to Environment File

Open `.env` and uncomment/add this line:

```bash
HUBSPOT_API_KEY=pat-na1-your-actual-key-here
```

### Step 3: Restart the Server

```bash
# If using npm run dev, it will auto-restart
# Or manually restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Verify Integration

You should see this in the console:
```
‚úÖ HubSpot client initialized
```

Instead of:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  HubSpot API key not configured - lead capture disabled
```

## üöÄ How It Works

### User Journey

1. **User Starts Conversation**
   - User: "I need help with data analytics"
   - Bot provides helpful information

2. **Natural Lead Collection**
   - After 2-3 valuable exchanges, bot asks for contact info
   - Bot: "I'd love to send you a detailed breakdown. What's the best email to send that to?"

3. **Automatic Detection**
   - User: "Sure, it's john@example.com"
   - System automatically detects email

4. **HubSpot Capture**
   - Creates contact in HubSpot
   - Source: "LeniLani AI Chatbot"
   - Adds conversation as note
   - Sets lifecycle stage: Lead

5. **Continued Tracking**
   - Conversation continues
   - Additional info (phone, company) added to same contact
   - Full conversation appended to notes

## üéØ AI Lead Collection Strategy

The chatbot is programmed to naturally collect contact information using these strategies:

### After Providing Value (2-3 exchanges)
- "I'd love to send you a detailed breakdown of how we could implement this for your business. What's the best email to send that to?"

### Before Scheduling
- "This sounds like a great fit for our services. Can I get your name and email so I can have our team prepare a custom proposal for you?"

### For Personalized Consultation
- "Before we schedule that consultation, let me get your contact information so Reno can review our conversation and come prepared with specific recommendations for your situation."

## üß™ Testing the Integration

### Test 1: Provide Email in Conversation
1. Open http://localhost:3000/chat
2. Have a conversation
3. Provide your email: "My email is test@example.com"

5. Check HubSpot for new contact

### Test 2: Manual API Test

    "firstname": "Test",
    "lastname": "User",

  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{

  "isNew": true,
  "message": "Lead captured successfully in HubSpot"
}
```

- Clear purpose (sending follow-up materials, scheduling consultations)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "HubSpot API key not configured"

**Cause**: HUBSPOT_API_KEY not in .env file

**Solution**:
1. Add key to .env: `HUBSPOT_API_KEY=pat-na1-...`
2. Restart server
3. Look for "‚úÖ HubSpot client initialized"

### Issue: "Error creating contact: Forbidden"

**Cause**: API key lacks required permissions

**Solution**:
1. Go to HubSpot ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Private Apps
2. Edit your app
3. Add these scopes:
   - `crm.objects.contacts.write`
   - `crm.objects.contacts.read`
   - `crm.objects.notes.write`
4. Save and regenerate token if needed

### Issue: Duplicate contacts created

**Cause**: Email detection issue or search failing

**Solution**:
- System should prevent duplicates by searching first
- Check console for "Found existing contact" messages
- Verify email regex is detecting correctly
- Check HubSpot API response for errors

### Issue: Conversation notes not appearing

**Cause**: Note creation permission or association issue

**Solution**:
- Verify `crm.objects.notes.write` scope
- Check console for note creation errors
- Verify association type ID (should be 202)
